## Analaysing

 #### I will be predicting the emission level of CO2 emissions in a fuel consumption dataset from Kaggle. The dataset contains various features such as fuel consumption, transmission type, and engine size. My aim is to use five regression techniques and plot scatterplots of each column against emission. First, I will import the necessary libraries such as pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and sklearn. I will load the dataset using pandas. After that, I will clean and preprocess the data by removing missing values, dropping irrelevant columns,dropping duplicates,feature selection etc...


### Model
##### 4WD/4X4 = Four-wheel drive
##### AWD = All-wheel drive
##### CNG = Compressed natural gas
##### FFV = Flexible-fuel vehicle
##### NGV = Natural gas vehicle
##### '#' = High output engine that provides more power than the standard engine of the same size

### Transmission
##### A = Automatic
##### AM = Automated manual
##### AS = Automatic with select shift
##### AV = Continuously variable
##### M = Manual
##### 3 - 10 = Number of gears
##### Fuel Type
##### X = Regular gasoline
##### Z = Premium gasoline
##### D = Diesel
##### E = Ethanol (E85)
##### N = Natural Gas

### Fuel Consumption
City and highway fuel consumption ratings are shown in litres per 100 kilometres (L/100 km) - combined rating (55% city, 45% hwy) is shown in L/100 km and in miles per imperial gallon (mpg)
CO2 Emissions (g/km),Estimated tailpipe carbon dioxide emissions (in grams per kilometre) are based on fuel type and the combined fuel consumption rating.

### five regression techniques going to use
#### 1.linear regression
#### 2.decision tree regression
#### 3.random forest regression
#### 4. SVM
#### 5.gradientBoosting
